### Hi, I'm Radhika Morabia.

I'm a Software Engineer at [OpenTable](https://opentable.com), currently focused on full‑stack web development. I live & love in Oakland, CA.

Here are some things I'm proud of:

 - 900+ people are subscribed to my occasional newsletter where I talk about tech & careers. Sign up at [tinyletter.com/rmorabia](https://tinyletter.com/rmorabia).
 
 - 60+ hours of my lessons on Egghead have been viewed. See my lessons on Egghead [here](https://egghead.io/instructors/radhika-morabia).
 
 - If you want to read about what I'm thinking about right now, I write infrequently on my blog. Read that at [radhika.dev/blog](https://radhika.dev/blog/).

If you would like to reach me, I am accessible via:

- Email: [hi@rmorabia.com](mailto:hi@rmorabia.com)
- LinkedIn: [in/rmorabia](http://linkedin.com/in/rmorabia)
