### Hi, I'm Radhika Morabia.

I'm a Software Engineer at [OpenTable](https://opentable.com), currently working on building the booking & user experience for 100m+ diners a month.

I occasionally give talks, record lessons, stream code challenges, write open-source code, and write a newsletter.

I spend most of my time making absurdly large Spotify playlists, skateboarding, reading books, watching films, and writing about how media intersects with our lives.
 
If you want to read about what I'm thinking about right now, I write regularly on my blog. Check out [radhika.dev](https://radhika.dev/).

If you would like to reach me, I am accessible via:

- Email: [hi@rmorabia.com](mailto:hi@rmorabia.com)
- LinkedIn: [in/rmorabia](http://linkedin.com/in/rmorabia)
